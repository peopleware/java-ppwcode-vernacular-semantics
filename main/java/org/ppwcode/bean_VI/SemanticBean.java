/**
 * <p>A type that formalizes how to work with JavaBeans that represent
 *   real-world objects (objects with semantic meaning, non-utility objects,
 *   non-value objects).</p>
 * <p>Semantic objects should always be used <em>by reference</em>. For this reason,
 *   the contracts of {@link Object#equals(Object)} and {@link Object#hashCode()},
 *   inherited from {@link Object}, are frozen here.</p>
 * <p>Furthermore, in an ideal world, to keep things under control, there should be
 *   exactly <strong>1</strong> Java object for each relevant real-world object
 *   (abstraction function should be a surjection). Duplicate representatives of
 *   real-world objects make things very hard. Sadly, in very many cicrumstances,
 *   we cannot do without multiple representatives. In any case, to guard
 *   against accidental copy proliferation, semantic objects are non-cloneable.</p>
 * <p>Note that, as a consequence of the above, reference identity nor {@link #equals(Object)}
 *   can detect whether to semantic objects represent the same real-world object
 *   or not. If this is a concern, a semantically relevant separate method, e.g.,
 *   {@code representsSame(_T_ other)} should be added. Furthermore, not that even
 *   if another semantic object has exactly the same properties, it is not necessarily so
 *   that they both represent the same real-world object. Indeed, there <em>is</em>
 *   at least 1 other person in Belgium that has &quot;Jan Dockx&quot; as his name.</p>
 * <p>{@ink #toString()} should only be used for debugging and logging purposes. For
 *   semantic beans, {@ink #toString()} should return a {@link String} that shows
 *   the class name and hash code (like {@link Object#toString()} does, followed
 *   by a comma-separated list of
 *   <code><var>propertyName</var> = <var>propertyValue</var></code> entries.
 *   Experience shows that this is not that hard, but that great care should be taken
 *   that no infinite loop is introduced in the code when navigating over the
 *   object graph. Therefore, the general rule should be that <dfn>upstream</dfn>
 *   reference properties are listed (usually to-one associations), but
 *   <dfn>downstream</dfn> reference properties (usually to-many associations) should
 *   not.</p>
 * <p>{@link AbstractSemanticBean} offers hard implementations that enforce the
 *   above rules. As this interface doesn't really enforce anything through the compiler,
 *   it can be seen as a tagging interface.</p>
 *
 * @note This class is the result of a split of {@link RousseauBean} from the previous
 *       version.
 * @note In a previous version, we had a method {@code hasSameValues(RousseaBean rb)},
 *       meant to express the difference of having the samen values, {@link #equals(Object)}
 *       {@code ==}, and being a representative of the same real-world object.
 *       Yet, in practice it proved that this method was difficult to maintain in all
 *       subtypes, and was actually never used. It is removed in this version.
