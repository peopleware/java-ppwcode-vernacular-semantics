    <release version="IV v1.1.0/1.0" date="2005-04-19"
          description="CompoundPropertyException close throws exception">
      <action dev="jand" type="fix">
    CompoundPropertyException close() now throws IllegalStateException
    when called when already closed (can't close twice). This was introduced
    to better trace a weird error that occurred in OLTS. This is considered
    a bug fix in the contract (which is possible because
    IllegalStateException is a RuntimeException).
    For OLTS, this change has to appear also in a branch.
      </action>

      <action dev="wlambrec" type="add">
        Added Beans.getNavigatedPropertyValue:
    The value of the property <code>propertyExpression</code>
     of object <code>bean</code>. <code>propertyExpression</code>
       can be an expression to navigate through an object graph,
       of the form <code><var>property1</var>.<var>property2</var>.<var>property3</var></code>.

          description="PropertyException extra constructor">
      <action dev="jand" type="add">
        An extra constructor for PropertyExceptions, that take a boolean
        argument that says whether the exception occurs during initialization
        of the origin or not. If so, we should not carry a reference to
        the incomplete origin.

          description="PropertyException.getOrigin() can be null">
      <action dev="jand" type="update">
        PropertyExceptions no longer have a mandatory origin. This is needed to be able
        to throw PropertyExceptions during bean initialization. This change is
        incompatible, because an existing type invariant is removed.
        The BeanInstantiationException is not really deprecated, but maybe it should be.
