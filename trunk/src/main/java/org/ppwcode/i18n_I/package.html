<p>API for resource bundle load strategies and support for <acronym title="internationalization">i18n</acronym>  of labels for bean types and bean property labels.</p>
<h3>Resource Bundle Load Strategy</h3>
<p><acronym title="internationalized">i15d</acronym> applications generally have a <dfn>default locale</dfn>, which users
  can <dfn>override</dfn>,
  and a <dfn>fallback locale</dfn>. The <dfn>default locale</dfn> is dynamic,
  and depends on user preferences set outside the application. Preferences inside
  the application make it possible
  to <dfn>override</dfn> the default locale for the application only. If a locale
  that is preferred by the user is not supported by the application, the <dfn>fallback
  locale</dfn>  is used.</p>
<p>How the <dfn>default locale</dfn> for a given user is determined, differs
  significantly in different application contexts. In a desktop application,
  it is often given by OS settings. In a web application however, the the
  virtual machine runs on the server, and the server OS settings will differ
  from the preferences of the remote users, which also differ amongst themselves.
  In the HTTP request header however, there are entries that express the remote
  user's locale preferences. This information is dealt with differently in different
  web application frameworks (e.g., JSTL <code>fmt</code>, and Struts).</p>
<p>Furthermore, applications can have i18n strategies that differ completely
  from the <dfn>default - override - fallback locale strategy</dfn> described
  above.</p>
<p>{@link be.peopleware.i18n_I.ResourceBundleLoadStrategy} is an API that makes
  it possible to abstract <acronym title="internationalization">i18n</acronym> code from a particular strategy. It implements
  the <dfn>Strategy Pattern</dfn>. The interface only features 1 method: {@link
  be.peopleware.i18n_I.ResourceBundleLoadStrategy#loadResourceBundle(String)}.</p>
<p>{@link be.peopleware.i18n_I.DefaultResourceBundleLoadStrategy} implements
  a default strategy, that can be used for desktop applications. Other strategies
  are defined in other libraries.</p>
<h3>Bean Type Labels and Bean Property Labels</h3>
<p><acronym title="internationalization">I18n</acronym> is long believed to be
  an issue in the view layer of an application, and certainly outside the scope
  of people working on the semantics, the business logic, of the application.
  We have seen that this is wrong, especially in the case of applications that
  manage structured data.</p>
<p>In such applications, a large part of the software developed in the world,
  the user interface often has a master-detail setup, and the screens features
  fields and labels for object properties, and a title that names the type of
  object that the screen displays. These property labels and type labels are
  what needs to be i15d in these applications. The exact labels are often deeply
  imbedded in business practices. For the end-user, it is of extreme importance
  that these labels reflect the day-to-day vocabularium that he is used to in
  his job.<br />
  The extraction of this vocabularium, in different languages, is a highly important
  aspect in the requirements and analysis phase of a software project. These
  labels are to be considered part of the semantics of the application, and should
  be guarded as much as the algorithms that implement business processes.<br />
  We therefor believe that these labels should be under control of the same developers
  that create and maintain the application semantics, and should be stored next
  to the Java classes that embed the business semantics.</p>
<p>This package provides support for the labels of JavaBean types and properties.</p>
<h4>Properties Files</h4>
<p>To use these methods, you should create properties files for every bean class
  you want to define type and properties labels for. The properties files should
  have the same FQN as the bean class. So, for a bean type:</p>
<pre>package be.peopleware.example;


public class Person {

  public String getName() {
    return $name;
  }

  public void setName(String name) {
    $name = name;
  }

  private String $name;



  public java.util.Date getDateOfBirth() {
    return (java.util.Date)$dob.clone();
  }

  public void setDateOfBirth(java.util.Date dob) {
    $dob = (java.util.Date)dob.clone();
  }

  private java.util.Date $dob;

}</pre>
<p>you should create properties files <kbd>$CLASSPATH/be/peopleware/example/Person<var>_locale</var>.properties.</kbd></p>
<p>In these properties files, you can have any entries you want, but a couple
  of keys are used by the methods in {@link be.peopleware.i18n_I.Properties}
  to return i18n labels for the type of the JavaBean and the properties of the
  JavaBean.</p>
<h5>Type Labels</h5>
<p>For the types of the JavaBean, there is a key for a label for the type ({@link
  be.peopleware.i18n_I.Properties#I18N_TYPE_LABEL_KEY} = <code>type</code>) and
  a key for the plural form of the type ({@link
  be.peopleware.i18n_I.Properties#I18N_PLURAL_TYPE_LABEL_KEY} = <code>type.plural</code>).</p>
<p> In the example, this would give for a file <kbd>$CLASSPATH/be/peopleware/example/Person_en_US.properties</kbd>:</p>
<pre>type=Person
type.plural=Persons</pre>
<p>and for dutch (<kbd>$CLASSPATH/be/peopleware/example/Person_nl_BE.properties</kbd>):</p>
<pre>type=Persoon
type.plural=Personen</pre>
<h5>Property Labels</h5>
<p>For the property labels, we forsee a regular and a short label (e.g., to be
  used in the heading of a tabular representation of a collection of persons).
  The keys are the programmatic name of the JavaBean property (e.g., <code>name</code>)
  with a prefix, resp., {@link be.peopleware.i18n_I.Properties#I18N_PROPERTY_LABEL_KEY_PREFIX
  } = <code>propertyName.&hellip;</code> 
  and <code>{@link be.peopleware.i18n_I.Properties#I18N_SHORT_PROPERTY_LABEL_KEY_PREFIX
  } = <code></code>propertyName.short.&hellip;</code>..</p>
<p>In the example, this would give for a file <kbd>$CLASSPATH/be/peopleware/example/Person_en_US.properties</kbd>:</p>
<pre>propertyName.name=Name
propertyName.dateOfBirth=Date of Birth
propertyName.short.name=N.
propertyName.short.dateOfBirth=&deg;</pre>
<p>and for dutch (<kbd>$CLASSPATH/be/peopleware/example/Person_nl_BE.properties</kbd>):</p>
<pre>propertyName.name=naam
propertyName.dateOfBirth=geboortedatum
propertyName.short.name=n.
propertyName.short.dateOfBirth=&deg;</pre>
<h4>Inheritance</h4>
<p>When a given key is not found in a particular properties files, the entire
  graph of the supertypes (both interfaces and classes) is used to search for
  the nearest entry with a matching key. Thus, if we have a class:</p>
<pre>package be.peopleware.example;

public class Male extends Person {

  public boolean isBariton() {
    return $bariton;
  }
	
  public void setBariton(boolean bariton) {
    $bariton = bariton;
  }
	
  private boolean $bariton;

}</pre>
<p>and associated properties files:</p>
<p>In the example, this would give for a file <kbd>$CLASSPATH/be/peopleware/example/Male_en_US.properties</kbd>:</p>
<pre>propertyName.bariton=Bariton
propertyName.short.bariton=Bar?</pre>
<p>and for dutch (<kbd>$CLASSPATH/be/peopleware/example/Male_nl_BE.properties</kbd>):</p>
<pre>propertyName.bariton=Bariton
propertyName.short.bariton=Bar?</pre>
<p>the lookup for the label of the property <code>name</code> for the type <code>Male</code></p>
<pre>String nameLabel = be.peopleware.i18n.Properties.
    i18nPropertyLabel(&quot;name&quot;, be.peopleware.example.Male, false, myStrategy);</pre>
<p>will
  still produce the correct <code>String</code>.</p>
<h4>Access</h4>
<p>The class {@link be.peopleware.i18n_I.Properties} offers a number of static
  methods to access these labels. Constants are defined here for the keys, etcetera.</p>
<h3>Note on the Acronyms</h3>
<p>The term <acronym title="internationalization">i18n</acronym> comes
    from the word <var>internationalization</var>,
    which has 18 letters between the initial <var>i</var> and the final <var>n</var>.
    Similarly, <var>internationalized</var> has 15 letters between the <var>i</var> and
    the <var>d</var>,
    hence the acronym <acronym title="internationalized">i15d</acronym>. Finally,
    the word <var>international</var> has 11 letters
    between the <var>i</var> and the <var>n</var>, and thus we write <acronym title="international">i11n</acronym>.</p>
<p>@todo add the JSP library here (EL functions) or better, after stuff is moved
  to ppw-bean, immediately there</p>
