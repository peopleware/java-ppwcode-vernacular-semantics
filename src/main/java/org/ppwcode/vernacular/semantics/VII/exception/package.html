<p>API expressing the ppwcode Semantics Exception vernacular.</p>
<p>{@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.semantics_I.exception.PropertyException} is the root of a hierarchy
  of exceptions, thrown by Java objects expressing semantics (e.g.,
  {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.semantics_I.bean.SemanticBean} instances), that express semantic
  violations. These are internal exceptions, meaning, according to the
  <a href="http://doc.ppwcode.org/java/ppwcode-vernacular-exception-IV/1.0.1/index.html" target="_top">ppwcode Exception vernacular</a>,
  that they are exceptions that are relevant to the end user. Subtypes should be created to carry
  as much dynamic information about the exception that occurred as possible.</p>
<p>{@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.semantics_I.exception.ValuePropertyException} and
  {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.semantics_I.exception.SetterPropertyException} are specialized subtypes
  that are often used, carrying the extra information, respectively, of a current value, and of a
  current and a vetoed value. More subtypes may be added as this package evolves.</p>
 <p>Often, when communicating to the user, it is needed to communicate more than one semantic problem
  at the same time, for a good user experience. This is certainly the case with asynchronous user
  interfaces, such as classic web applications.
  {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.semantics_I.exception.CompoundPropertyException} is a vehicle to gather and
  transport several property (semantic) exceptions at once.</p>
 <p>Since the exceptions featured here are foremost relevant to the end user, internationalization (18n)
  of the messages is important. The
  <a href="http://doc.ppwcode.org/java/ppwcode-vernacular-exception-IV/1.0.1/index.html" target="_top">ppwcode Exception vernacular</a>
  foresees this, but in this vernacular, we expand on that. In this package, the <code>properties</code>
  files needed for this internationalization or also present.</p>
