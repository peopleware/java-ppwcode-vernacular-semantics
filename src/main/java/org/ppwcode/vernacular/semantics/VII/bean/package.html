<title>ppwcode Semantics Bean vernacular</title>

<p>API expressing the ppwcode Semantics Bean vernacular.</p>
<p>{@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.semantics.VII.bean.SemanticBean} is the basis of our vernacular.
  It expresses that semantic beans should be used by reference, and that they should feature
  a {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.semantics_I.bean.SemanticBean#toString()} method aimed
  at debugging and logging. {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.semantics.VII.bean.AbstractSemanticBean}
  provides help in implementing these rules.</p>
<p>{@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.semantics.VII.bean.RousseauBean} introduces the notion of
  <dfn>civilized</dfn> and <dfn>wild</dfn> state for semantic beans, making explicit the
  difference in state that is acceptable for naked Java objects, and the state that is acceptable
  when those Java objects truly represent a domain object. This depends on the vernacular for
  semantic exceptions laid out in {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.semantics.VII.exception}.
  {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.semantics.VII.bean.AbstractRousseauBean} provides help in implementing
  this contract.</p>
